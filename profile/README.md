## 🧠 What Is the L2 Item Dupe?

The **Lineage 2 Item Dupe** is an exploit-based technique (not a trainer or injector) that **abuses packet lag, storage sync issues, or delayed confirmations** to duplicate high-value items in inventory.

It may require:

* Delayed trades
* Fast relogging
* Lag switch tools
* Private server timing bugs

Best used on **private servers** where patching is slow or anti-cheat is weak. Works with **enchanted gear**, **Adena stacks**, **jewels**, **scrolls**, and sometimes **event items** depending on the method.
